I will not be providing direct support for this gamemode; if you have an issue or come across actual functionality issues please raise an issue in the **issues** tab. Otherwise; additional help can be found by subscribing through [my twitch page and joining discord](https://www.twitch.tv/stuyksoft/).

### Licensing

If you'd like to remove the splash screens at any point; we can negotiate at a price. However, you will be responsible for removing them and not me. Otherwise, just leave the splash screens alone. This is a free framework and the least you can do is give credit.

### General Information and Hotkeys

```

z -------> Press and hold to reveal cursor.
z + rmb -> Show Context Menu on User
z + lmb -> Select Context Option

### Installation

If you don't have NodeJS; please go install it.

The file structure below is the **required** structure you must use for this game mode. You must follow it exactly for this resource to work.

-   Grab the latest version of the alt:V server files. They must be clean. No resources.

-   Download [Postgres-Wrapper](https://github.com/team-stuyk-alt-v/altV-Postgres-Wrapper) this is the Postgres SQL helper that was written to make database usage easy. Extract it and put this into a folder called `postgres-wrapper`. Directly inside you should have `resource.cfg` if done correctly.

-   Install the latest version of [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) for either windows, linux, or whatever OS you're running.

-   Once installed you need to create a username and password for your database; and create a database called 'altv' or something else if you know what you're doing. **PAY ATTENTION HERE YOU'LL NEED THIS INFO**

**Creating on Windows with pgAdmin4**
Where to navigate:

Postgres is the username for this database; and altv is the name:

After; it should be running automatically in your services on windows. You can always restart your database through your Task Manager.

-   Download the latest version of this resource. You can either clone the repository or simply download it. The `resource.cfg` and the rest of the files should be directly inside of a folder called `orp`.

-   To configure your database navigate to `resources/orp/server/configuration/` and open `database.mjs`. Fill out the required parameters; and change them to what you setup PostgreSQL with.

**Example Database Configuration**

```js
export const DatabaseInfo = {
    username: 'postgres',
    password: 'abc123',
    address: 'localhost',
    port: 5432,
    dbname: 'altv'
};
```

**Example Folder Structure**

```yaml
altVServerFolder/
â””â”€â”€ resources/
|   â”œâ”€â”€ orp/
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ server/
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ client/
|   |   â””â”€â”€ resource.cfg
|   â”œâ”€â”€ postgres-wrapper/
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ client.mjs
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ database.mjs
|   |	â””â”€â”€ resource.cfg
â””â”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ altv-server.exe
â””â”€â”€ node_modules/
```

**Installing Packages for NodeJS**
After installing the above; if you don't have a package.json in your main server directory where your .exe is you're going to need to do the following:

Open a command prompt or powershell next to your .exe file

```
npm init
```

Then press enter a bunch of times until its done stepping you through.

After you need to install the following packages from command prompt or power shell.

```
npm install typeorm
npm install sjcl
npm install pg
```

Great; now you have all the prerequisites.

Open your `server.cfg` next to your `altv-server.exe`.

You need to add `orp` to resources.

```
name: 'Open RP'
host: 0.0.0.0
port: 7766
players: 1000

website: twitch.tv/stuykgaming
language: lang-here

That's about it; once you run it you'll be greeted with terms and conditions and you can follow the additional instructions from there.
