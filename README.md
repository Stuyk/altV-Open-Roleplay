### Licensing

If you'd like to remove the splash screens at any point; we can negotiate at a price. However, you will be responsible for removing them and not me. Otherwise, just leave the splash screens alone. This is a free framework and the least you can do is give credit.

### Installation

#### If you don't have NodeJS v12+; please go install it.

-   Install version **v11.5** of [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) for either windows, linux, or whatever OS you're running.

-   Once installed you need to create a username and password for your database; and create a database called 'altv' or something else if you know what you're doing. **PAY ATTENTION HERE YOU'LL NEED THIS INFO**

**Creating on Windows with pgAdmin4**
Where to navigate:
![](https://i.imgur.com/FBBeMTt.png)

Postgres is the username for this database; and altv is the name:
![](https://i.imgur.com/FaEmnvg.png)

After; it should be running automatically in your services on windows. You can always restart your database through your Task Manager.

**Creating on Linux with Terminal ( UBUNTU 18.04 (Don't use 16.04 it's a pain in the ass.) )**

-   Follow these instructions up to Step 3: [Installing Postgres on Ubuntu](https://tecadmin.net/install-postgresql-server-on-ubuntu/)

-   Type: `su - postgres`

-   Type: `psql`

-   Type: `CREATE DATABASE altv;`

-   If all is well you will see `CREATE DATABASE` or something similar replied.

-   Type: `CREATE USER stuyk WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'abc123';`

-   If all is well you will see `CREATE ROLE` replied.

-   We now have a user called `stuyk` with a password of `abc123`. We need to assign to db.

-   Type: `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE altv TO stuyk;`

-   If all is well you wil see `GRANT` replied.

-   Type: `\q` to exit.

-   Type: `sudo -u root`

-   This will bring you back to your root account.

-   Now follow the rest of the steps below.

---

-   Download the latest version of this resource.

-   Open a command prompt and run `npm run orp`. **FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY ON PROMPT**.

-   Run `altv-server.exe` or `./start.sh`. If you're on Linux you may need to set permission for `altv-server`.
